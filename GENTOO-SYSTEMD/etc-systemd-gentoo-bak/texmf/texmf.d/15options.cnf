%  Part 2: Options.

% If this option is set to true, `tex a.b' will look first for a.b.tex
% (within each path element), and then for a.b, i.e., we try standard
% extensions first.  If this is false, we first look for a.b and then
% a.b.tex, i.e., we try the name as-is first.
%
% Both names are always tried; the difference is the order in which they
% are tried.  The setting applies to all searches, not just .tex.
%
% This setting only affects names being looked up which *already* have
% an extension.  A name without an extension (e.g., `tex story') will
% always have an extension added first.
%
% The default is true, because we already avoid adding the standard
% extension(s) in the usual cases.  E.g., babel.sty will only look for
% babel.sty, not babel.sty.tex, regardless of this setting.
try_std_extension_first = t

% Enable system commands via \write18{...}.  When enabled fully (set to
% t), obviously insecure.  When enabled partially (set to p), only the

% enable it for everything but bare tex.

% 
% The programs listed here are as safe as any we know: they either do
% not write any output files, respect openout_any, or have hard-coded
% restrictions similar to or higher than openout_any=p.  They also have
% no features to invoke arbitrary other programs, and no known
% exploitable bugs.  All to the best of our knowledge.  They also have
% practical use for being called from TeX.

% it may be useful if you both (a) installed a full Perl distribution
% for general use, and (b) need to run Perl programs from TL that use
% additional modules we don't provide.  The TL Perl does provide all the
% standard Perl modules.
